2. Must have 1 or two objects selected via Illustrator's Selection Tool (V)

## HOW TO RUN
If you saved the script as [described above](#save-to-default-scripts), you should be able to run the script (after selecting one or two objects in the document) by navigating within Illustrator to:
```
File > Scripts > Specify
```
If you chose an alternate location to save the script, you may run by using the following path, and selecting the script file once you navigate to your designated folder:
```
File > Scripts > Other Script... 
```

#### Dimension a Single Object
Select a single object (or group) on your artboard and [run the script](#how-to-run) within Illustrator. 

With a single object selected, the script will display a dialog box and will specify the single dimension you chose. The dialog allows you to choose which dimension to specify (top, right, bottom, or left) which also corresponds to the placement of the dimension line and text.

#### Dimension Between Two Objects
Select two objects and [run the script](#how-to-run) within Illustrator

With two objects selected, the script will display a dialog box and will specify the single dimension between the two chosen objects. The dialog allows you to choose which dimension to specify (top, right, bottom, or left) which also corresponds to the placement of the dimension line and text.
